# Restaurant-website
Take a Peek at Our Restaurant Website Sample: This project offers a behind-the-scenes look at how we've created the front part of a restaurant's website using HTML and CSS. We've focused on making the website not only beautiful but also super easy to use.

The best part? The website adjusts itself to look great on big computer screens and small smartphone screens. It's like having your favorite restaurant right at your fingertips, no matter what device you're using.

We're on a mission to make the web a more delightful place, and this project is our starting point. Feel free to explore our work and consider joining us in making websites that look amazing and work seamlessly for everyone.
